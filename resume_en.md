## Work Experience

### IT Company (S Corp) — *Apr 2022 – Nov 2023*

#### Authentication Platform Development (OIDC-based) — *Jun 2022 – Nov 2023*

**Overview:**  
Developed a new **OIDC-compliant authentication API platform** enabling unified accounts across multiple services. Integrated **SAP CDC** for user management. Development followed a waterfall model with small teams working on ~10 APIs per service.

**Role & Responsibilities:**  
- Designed API specifications and internal structures.  
- Implemented APIs in PHP.  
- Built automated tests using **Python (Pytest)**.  

**Challenges & Actions:**  
1. Lack of detailed design documentation → independently designed error handling and processing logic.  
2. No prior Pytest experience → self-learned Pytest and developed reusable test utilities.  
3. Optimized SAP CDC API calls to improve response times.  

**Environment:**  
- **Languages:** PHP, Python  
- **Frameworks:** Laravel, Pytest  
- **DB:** PostgreSQL  
- **Tools:** SAP CDC, Docker, Git, Backlog, Nginx  
- **Team Size:** ~10 (PMO, PM, PL, 6+ devs)  

**Achievements:**  
- Significantly reduced bug rate, achieving near-zero defects at unit test level.  
- Automated tests covered 50–60% of cases, reducing unit test execution time to ~30 minutes.
